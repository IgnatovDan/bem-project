# Validate BEM

A couple of rules/validators that helps to write correct BEM code: see the 'all' script in the 'package.json' for more details.

## How to use
1. Clone this repository into your environment
2. Copy your sources into the repository folder
3. Run the **'npm run all'** script to start validation
4. Review the output in console

In addition, use the 'npm run postcss-import' to combine all CSS files into a single file (then you can validate it on a public validation service).

## Used technologies:
- ESLint
- StyleLint
- PostCSS
- HTML Validate
- HTML Validator
- BEM rules
